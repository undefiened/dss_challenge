# USS to USS Communication and Synchronization [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/astm/dss/_apis/build/status/interuss.dss?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/astm/dss/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/interuss/dss?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/interuss/dss)

This repository contains the implementation of the Discovery and Synchronization Service (DSS) and a monitoring
framework to test UAS Service Suppliers (USS). See the [InterUSS website](https://interuss.org) for background information.

## Standards and Regulations

The DSS implementation and associated monitoring tools target compliance with the following standards and regulations:

- [ASTM F3411-19](https://www.astm.org/Standards/F3411.htm): Remote ID.
[See OpenAPI interface](./interfaces/uastech/standards/remoteid)
- [ASTM WK63418](https://www.astm.org/DATABASE.CART/WORKITEMS/WK63418.htm): UAS Traffic Management (UTM) UAS
Service Supplier (USS) Interoperability Specification.
[See OpenAPI interface](./interfaces/astm-utm)

U-Space specific:
- [COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2021/664](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32021R0664&from=EN#d1e32-178-1)

## Discovery and Synchronization Service (DSS)

The DSS is a simple and open service used by separate USSs, often in different organizations, to communicate
information about UAS operations and coordinate with each other. This service is described in the ASTM remote
ID standard. This flexible and distributed system is used to connect multiple USSs operating in the same general
area to share information while protecting operator and consumer privacy. The system is focused on facilitating
communication amongst actively operating USSs without details about UAS operations stored or processed in the DSS.

## Monitoring and UAS Service Suppliers (USS) testing

In addition to the DSS, this repository contains tools for USSs to test and validate their implementation of the
services such as Remote ID (ASTM F3411-19) and Strategic Conflict Detection defined in ASTM WK63418, UAS Traffic
Management (UTM) UAS Service Supplier (USS) Interoperability Specification.
