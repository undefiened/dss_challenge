# DSS implementation with Vertiport Management for EUROCONTROL challenge

This repository is a fork of InterUSS implementation of the Discovery and Synchronization Service (DSS) with our (Link√∂ping University) proof-of-concept implementation of vertiport management made as a submission to EUROCONTROL Challenge. Please contact the repository owner for additional information. The code in this repository is not suitable for any use and may have serious errors. This code only serves as a proof of concept.

Please refer to the [InterUSS website](https://interuss.org) and [InterUSS github repository](https://github.com/interuss/dss) for their original DSS implementation without our changes.
